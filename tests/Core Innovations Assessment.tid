''Potential Claims:''
* System and method for managing software development lifecycle using dynamic knowledge graphs
* Real-time inference engine for automated impact analysis
* Ontology-driven software artifact relationship management

''Prior Art Risk:'' ⚠️ Medium - Need to differentiate from general knowledge graphs and Build.One platform

---

!!! 2. Multi-Agent Collaborative Code Generation 🟢
''Innovation:'' Specialized AI agents with knowledge graph context for coordinated development

''Merits:''
* ✅ Specific technical architecture for multi-agent coordination
* ✅ Novel use of shared knowledge graph for agent communication
* ✅ Automated task decomposition and assignment algorithms

''Potential Claims:''
* Multi-agent system for automated software development with shared context
* Method for decomposing software features into agent-specific tasks
* Coordination protocol for specialized development agents

''Prior Art Risk:'' ⚠️ Medium-High - Need to distinguish from general multi-agent systems

* ✅ Specific technical solution to test brittleness problem
* ✅ Novel combination of visual AI + test automation
* ✅ Clear performance improvements demonstrable

''Potential Claims:''
* System for automatic test script repair using visual analysis
* Method for maintaining test automation through UI changes
* AI-driven test element identification and updating

''Prior Art Risk:'' ⚠️ Low-Medium - Limited prior art in this specific domain

---

!! Medium Patentability Innovations

!!! 4. Automated Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Generation 🟡
''Innovation:'' AI-generated architectural decisions with trade-off analysis

''Merits:''
* ✅ Specific application of AI to architectural decision making
* ✅ Novel structured approach to ADR automation
* ✅ Integration with project knowledge graph

''Challenges:''
* ⚠️ May be seen as obvious application of AI to existing ADR practice
* ⚠️ Need to emphasize technical innovation beyond basic automation

---

!!! 5. Predictive Deployment Failure Analysis 🟡
''Innovation:'' ML models predicting deployment success based on change complexity

''Merits:''
* ✅ Specific application domain with measurable benefits
* ✅ Novel feature combination for risk assessment

''Challenges:''
* ⚠️ Predictive analytics in software deployment may have prior art

---

!! Lower Patentability Areas

!!! 6. OOSE Methodology Automation 🔴
''Innovation:'' Automated execution of OOSE phases

''Challenges:''
* ❌ OOSE is established methodology - may be seen as obvious automation
* ❌ Need to focus on specific technical innovations rather than process automation
* ❌ Abstract ideas without concrete technical implementation

''Strategy:'' Focus on specific technical implementations rather than methodology automation

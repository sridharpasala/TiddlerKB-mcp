# AI Prompts for Analysis Model Generation

## 1. Boundary Class Identification

```
You are an OOSE analysis expert. Identify boundary classes for the following system:

Use Cases: [USE_CASE_LIST]
Actors: [ACTOR_LIST]
System Type: [WEB/MOBILE/DESKTOP]

For each use case:
1. Identify all boundary classes (interfaces between actors and system)
2. Name them using pattern: [Purpose]UI or [Purpose]Interface
3. List responsibilities of each boundary class
4. Identify which actor interacts with which boundary class

Output format:
- Boundary Class Name
- Type (GUI/API/Device Interface)
- Responsible for
- Interacts with Actor(s)
- Related Use Case(s)
```

## 2. Control Class Generation

```
Analyze the following use cases and generate control classes:

Use Case Specifications: [USE_CASE_DETAILS]

For each use case:
1. Create one control class (named [UseCaseName]Controller)
2. Define its coordination responsibilities
3. List the boundary and entity classes it coordinates
4. Describe the main flow it orchestrates

Include:
- Control Class Name
- Primary Responsibility
- Coordinated Classes
- Key Operations/Methods
- Business Logic Rules enforced
```

## 3. Entity Class Extraction

```
Based on the domain model, create entity classes:

Domain Model: [DOMAIN_MODEL]
Business Rules: [BUSINESS_RULES]

For each domain concept:
1. Create an entity class
2. Define core attributes (only domain-relevant)
3. Identify key behaviors/responsibilities
4. Note persistence requirements
5. Define invariants and constraints

Output:
- Entity Class Name
- Description
- Key Attributes
- Core Responsibilities
- Business Rules/Invariants
- Relationships to other entities
```

## 4. Sequence Diagram Generation

```
Create a sequence diagram for the following use case:

Use Case: [USE_CASE_NAME]
Main Flow: [MAIN_FLOW_STEPS]
Participating Classes:
- Boundary: [BOUNDARY_CLASSES]
- Control: [CONTROL_CLASS]
- Entity: [ENTITY_CLASSES]

Generate:
1. Actor initiating the sequence
2. Message flows between objects
3. Object lifelines
4. Activation bars
5. Return messages
6. Any loops or conditions

Output: PlantUML sequence diagram code with clear message names
```

## 5. Class Diagram for Analysis Model

```
Create an analysis class diagram showing relationships:

Boundary Classes: [BOUNDARY_LIST]
Control Classes: [CONTROL_LIST]
Entity Classes: [ENTITY_LIST]
Use Case: [USE_CASE_CONTEXT]

Show:
1. All three types of classes (use stereotypes)
2. Associations with multiplicities
3. Dependencies
4. Key attributes for entity classes
5. Main operations for each class type

Guidelines:
- Boundary classes don't directly access entity classes
- Control classes coordinate between boundary and entity
- Entity classes can associate with each other

Output: PlantUML class diagram following OOSE notation
```

## 6. State Diagram Generation

```
Create a state diagram for the following entity class:

Entity Class: [CLASS_NAME]
Class Description: [DESCRIPTION]
Business Rules: [RELEVANT_RULES]
Key Operations: [OPERATIONS_LIST]

Identify:
1. All possible states
2. Transitions between states
3. Events triggering transitions
4. Guards/conditions
5. Entry/exit actions
6. Initial and final states

Output: PlantUML state diagram with clear state names and transitions
```

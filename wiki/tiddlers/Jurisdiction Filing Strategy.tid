!! United States 🇺🇸 - Priority Filing

''Advantages:''
* ✅ Strong software patent protection
* ✅ First-to-file system
* ✅ Broad claim interpretation
* ✅ Strong enforcement mechanisms

''Filing Strategy:''
# **Provisional Patent Application** (12-month priority period)
#* Cost: $1,600-3,200 (small entity)
#* Timeline: File within 6 months of public disclosure
#* Strategy: File broad provisional covering all core innovations
# **Non-Provisional Application**
#* Cost: $8,000-15,000 per application (with attorney fees)
#* Timeline: Within 12 months of provisional
#* Strategy: File 3-4 focused applications covering core innovations

''Key Considerations:''
* Emphasize technical solutions to technical problems
* Include detailed technical architecture diagrams
* Focus on specific algorithms and data structures
* Avoid abstract ideas - emphasize concrete implementations

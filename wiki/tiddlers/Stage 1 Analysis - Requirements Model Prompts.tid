# Stage 1: Analysis - Requirements Model Prompts

## Prompt 1: Complete Use Case Model Generation

```
You are an expert requirements analyst specializing in OOSE methodology. Generate a complete Use Case Model for the following system:

System Name: [SYSTEM_NAME]
System Description: [SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION]
Business Context: [BUSINESS_CONTEXT]
User Types: [USER_TYPES]

Generate the following artifacts:

1. USE CASE DIAGRAM
- Identify all actors (primary, secondary, external systems)
- List 10-20 use cases based on system complexity
- Show include/extend relationships
- Define system boundary clearly
- Output: PlantUML code

2. ACTOR CATALOG
For each actor provide:
- Actor ID (ACT-XXX)
- Actor Name
- Type (Human/System/External)
- Description
- Responsibilities
- Goals
- Use cases they participate in
- Special access requirements

3. USE CASE SPECIFICATIONS
For the top 5 critical use cases, provide:
- Use Case ID (UC-XXX)
- Use Case Name
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Actors (Primary and Secondary)
- Description (2-3 sentences)
- Trigger
- Preconditions
- Main Flow (numbered steps)
- Alternative Flows (at least 2)
- Exception Flows
- Postconditions
- Business Rules
- Non-functional Requirements
- Frequency of Use
- Special Requirements

Format the output as:
1. PlantUML diagram code
2. Structured actor catalog (table or JSON)
3. Detailed use case specifications

Ensure all artifacts are consistent and traceable.
```

## Prompt 2: Domain Model and Business Rules

```
You are a domain modeling expert. Analyze the following business domain and create a comprehensive domain model:

Domain: [DOMAIN_NAME]
Business Description: [BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION]
Key Business Processes: [PROCESS_LIST]
Industry Constraints: [CONSTRAINTS]

Generate:

1. CONCEPTUAL DOMAIN MODEL
- Identify all business entities (nouns)
- Define attributes for each entity
- Establish relationships with multiplicities
- Identify aggregations and compositions
- Note inheritance hierarchies if any
- Output: PlantUML class diagram

2. BUSINESS VOCABULARY/GLOSSARY
For each domain term:
- Term name
- Definition
- Synonyms
- Usage context
- Related terms

3. BUSINESS RULES CATALOG
For each rule provide:
- Rule ID (BR-XXX)
- Rule Name
- Category (Validation/Calculation/Constraint/Derivation)
- Description
- Implementation Notes
- Source/Authority
- Examples
- Exceptions

4. ENTITY DESCRIPTIONS
For each major entity:
- Entity name
- Business meaning
- Key attributes and their meanings
- Lifecycle (creation to deletion)
- Business constraints
- Relationships explained

5. DOMAIN CONSTRAINTS
- Invariants that must always be true
- Cross-entity constraints
- Temporal constraints
- Business process constraints

Format as structured documentation with clear sections.
```

## Prompt 3: Non-Functional Requirements and System Scope

```
You are a systems architect specializing in requirements engineering. Define comprehensive non-functional requirements and system scope:

System: [SYSTEM_NAME]
Type: [SYSTEM_TYPE]
Stakeholders: [STAKEHOLDER_LIST]
Deployment Context: [DEPLOYMENT_CONTEXT]
Expected Scale: [SCALE_METRICS]

Generate:

1. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

Performance Requirements:
- Response time (by operation type)
- Throughput requirements
- Resource utilization limits
- Batch processing windows

Scalability Requirements:
- User load (concurrent/total)
- Data volume growth
- Geographic distribution
- Scaling strategy

Security Requirements:
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization levels
- Data encryption needs
- Audit requirements
- Compliance standards

Reliability Requirements:
- Availability targets (uptime %)
- Mean time between failures
- Mean time to repair
- Disaster recovery
- Backup requirements

Usability Requirements:
- User interface standards
- Accessibility requirements
- Training needs
- Documentation standards
- Internationalization

Compatibility Requirements:
- Browser/device support
- Integration requirements
- Data exchange formats
- Legacy system support

For each requirement provide:
- ID (NFR-XXX)
- Category
- Description
- Measurable criteria
- Priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Verification method

2. SYSTEM SCOPE DEFINITION
- In-scope features (detailed list)
- Out-of-scope items (explicitly excluded)
- System boundaries
- External interfaces
- Assumptions
- Dependencies
- Constraints

3. REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY MATRIX
Create initial matrix structure showing:
- Requirement ID
- Type (Functional/Non-functional)
- Source (stakeholder/document)
- Priority
- Related use cases
- Verification criteria

Format as structured specification document with clear categorization.

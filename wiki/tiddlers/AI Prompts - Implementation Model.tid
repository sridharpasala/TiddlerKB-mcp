# AI Prompts for Implementation Model Generation

## 1. Class Implementation

```
Implement the following design class:

Design Class Specification:
- Class Name: [CLASS_NAME]
- Package: [PACKAGE_NAME]
- Attributes: [ATTRIBUTE_LIST]
- Methods: [METHOD_SIGNATURES]
- Business Rules: [RULES]
- Design Pattern: [PATTERN_IF_ANY]

Technology Stack: [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]
Coding Standards: [STANDARDS_REFERENCE]

Generate:
1. Complete class implementation
2. Constructor(s)
3. All methods with business logic
4. Input validation
5. Error handling
6. Logging statements
7. Comments and documentation
8. Unit test stubs

Follow best practices for the chosen technology.
```

## 2. Database Implementation Scripts

```
Create database implementation scripts:

Database Schema: [SCHEMA_DEFINITION]
Database Type: [DATABASE_TYPE]
Environment: [DEV/TEST/PROD]

Generate:
1. CREATE TABLE statements
2. Indexes and constraints
3. Stored procedures/functions (if applicable)
4. Triggers for audit trails
5. Initial seed data
6. Migration scripts
7. Rollback scripts

Include:
- Performance optimizations
- Partitioning strategy (if needed)
- Security configurations
- Database-specific features
```

## 3. API Endpoint Implementation

```
Implement REST API endpoints:

API Specification: [OPENAPI_SPEC]
Framework: [SPRING_BOOT/EXPRESS/FASTAPI/etc]
Design Class: [CONTROLLER_CLASS]
Service Classes: [SERVICE_CLASSES]

For each endpoint generate:
1. Controller/Route implementation
2. Request validation
3. Service layer calls
4. Error handling
5. Response formatting
6. Authentication/Authorization checks
7. Logging and monitoring hooks
8. API documentation annotations

Include proper HTTP status codes and error responses.
```

## 4. Configuration Management

```
Create configuration files for the application:

Application: [APP_NAME]
Environments: [DEV/TEST/STAGING/PROD]
Components: [COMPONENT_LIST]
External Services: [SERVICE_LIST]

Generate:
1. Application configuration files
2. Environment-specific settings
3. Database connection configs
4. API keys and secrets (templated)
5. Logging configurations
6. Security settings
7. Feature flags
8. Container configurations (if applicable)

Use appropriate format: [YAML/JSON/Properties/XML]
```

## 5. Build and Deployment Scripts

```
Create build and deployment automation:

Project Type: [PROJECT_TYPE]
Build Tool: [MAVEN/GRADLE/NPM/etc]
Target Environment: [ENVIRONMENT]
CI/CD Platform: [JENKINS/GITHUB_ACTIONS/GITLAB/etc]

Generate:
1. Build configuration file
2. Dependency management
3. Build scripts
4. Test execution commands
5. Packaging instructions
6. Deployment scripts
7. Environment setup scripts
8. Health check implementations

Include:
- Version management
- Artifact publishing
- Rollback procedures
```

## 6. Integration Implementation

```
Implement integration with external systems:

External System: [SYSTEM_NAME]
Integration Type: [REST/SOAP/MESSAGE_QUEUE/DATABASE]
Design Specifications: [INTEGRATION_DESIGN]

Generate:
1. Client/Connector implementation
2. Data mapping/transformation
3. Error handling and retry logic
4. Circuit breaker pattern (if applicable)
5. Monitoring and alerting
6. Mock implementations for testing
7. Configuration for different environments

Include:
- Timeout configurations
- Connection pooling
- Security implementations
- Logging of all interactions
```

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

```
Implement cross-cutting concerns:

Application: [APP_NAME]
Concerns: [LOGGING/SECURITY/CACHING/MONITORING]
Framework: [FRAMEWORK]

Generate implementations for:
1. Logging framework setup and patterns
2. Security filters/interceptors
3. Caching layer implementation
4. Performance monitoring
5. Error tracking
6. Audit trail implementation
7. Transaction management
8. Validation framework

Ensure minimal coupling with business logic.

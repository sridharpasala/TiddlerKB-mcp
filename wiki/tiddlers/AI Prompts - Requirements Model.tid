# AI Prompts for Requirements Model Generation

## 1. Use Case Diagram Generation

```
You are an expert business analyst. Generate a Use Case diagram for the following system:

System Description: [SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION]
Key Stakeholders: [STAKEHOLDER_LIST]
Primary Goals: [BUSINESS_GOALS]

Please identify:
1. All actors (primary, secondary, and external systems)
2. Main use cases (10-15 for a medium system)
3. Include/extend relationships
4. System boundary

Output format: PlantUML code for the use case diagram
```

## 2. Use Case Specification

```
You are a requirements analyst. Create a detailed use case specification for:

Use Case Name: [USE_CASE_NAME]
Context: [SYSTEM_CONTEXT]
Actor: [PRIMARY_ACTOR]

Generate:
1. Use Case ID (UC-XXX format)
2. Brief description (2-3 sentences)
3. Pre-conditions
4. Main flow (numbered steps)
5. Alternative flows (at least 2)
6. Exception flows
7. Post-conditions
8. Business rules
9. Non-functional requirements
10. Frequency of use

Follow the standard use case template format.
```

## 3. Domain Model Generation

```
You are a domain modeling expert. Create a conceptual domain model for:

Domain: [DOMAIN_NAME]
Description: [DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION]
Key Business Processes: [PROCESS_LIST]

Identify:
1. Core domain entities (nouns from the description)
2. Attributes for each entity
3. Relationships between entities (with multiplicities)
4. Key business constraints

Output: 
- List of entities with descriptions
- PlantUML class diagram showing relationships
- Business rules that govern the domain
```

## 4. Actor Catalog

```
Generate a comprehensive actor catalog for the system:

System: [SYSTEM_NAME]
Use Cases Identified: [USE_CASE_LIST]

For each actor provide:
1. Actor name
2. Actor type (Primary/Secondary/External System)
3. Description (role and responsibilities)
4. Goals/objectives
5. Use cases they participate in
6. Special requirements or constraints

Format as a structured table or JSON.
```

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

```
You are a systems architect. Define non-functional requirements for:

System: [SYSTEM_NAME]
Type: [SYSTEM_TYPE]
Expected Users: [USER_COUNT]
Deployment Environment: [ENVIRONMENT]

Generate requirements for:
1. Performance (response time, throughput)
2. Scalability (concurrent users, data volume)
3. Security (authentication, authorization, data protection)
4. Reliability (uptime, failure recovery)
5. Usability (user experience standards)
6. Compatibility (browsers, devices, integrations)
7. Maintainability (coding standards, documentation)
8. Regulatory compliance

For each requirement, provide:
- ID (NFR-XXX)
- Category
- Description
- Measurable criteria
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
```
